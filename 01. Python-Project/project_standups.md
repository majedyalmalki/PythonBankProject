## Project Week Daily Standups
• Each day during project week we will hold two 'standups'. One in the morning and one in the afternoon. These standups are a common practice within engineering companies as as means of ensuring engineers are on track to complete their work and that they are not in need of support. 

• Within this course we will use these standups for that exact reason and to help you get into a similar flow. While standups tend to be outloud so the team can hear where you may need support, we will do this electronically to keep things simple and give you more time in class to work. 

• With the above message in mind, we will collect the same three pieces of information for each student when we arrive in the morning, and again when we come back from lunch in the afternoon. This will also count for your attendance.

The questions:

1. What are you currently working on?
2. How many commits have you made?
3. Are there any bugs or blockers at the moment?

• Please copy and paste the questions above into slack in the converation with the instructors along with your answers to each question. Remember to make commits frequently! Good luck!
